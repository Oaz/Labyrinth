Explore impact of TDD of simultaneous development of 2 related transformations from a single datamodel

I have a simple datamodel to represent a labyrinth : a 2D array of blocks ; each block has 4 sides ; wall on each side can be closed or not

I want to display such a labyrinth using unicode blocks : ┏ ┓ ┗ ┛   ┳ ┫┣ ┻  ╋  ┃  ━  ╸╺╻╹

I can use a small display :
┏┳━┳━┓
┃┗╸┃╻┃
┃╺┓┗┛┃
┗━┻━━┛

Or I can use a large display :
┏━┳━━┳━━━┓
┃ ┃  ┃   ┃
┃ ┗━ ┃ ╻ ┃
┃    ┃ ┃ ┃
┃ ━┓ ┗━┛ ┃
┃  ┃     ┃
┗━━┻━━━━━┛

I want to experiment how the development of the 2 displays impact eaxh other
